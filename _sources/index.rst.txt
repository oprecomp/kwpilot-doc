Welcome to OPRECOMP kwPilot documentation!
==================================

This page is the documentation of kw-Pilot system, a transprecision system developed by `OPRECOMP <http://oprecomp.eu/>`_.

Specifically kw-Pilot is developed through the work-package 4 (WP4) of OPRECOMP. The aim of the work-package is to develop a hardware architecture that allows fine-grained control of both temporal and spatial precision, in order to achieve energy-precision tradeoffs over a wide range.

OPRECOMP vision for the kW range is the demonstration of architecture through FPGA Emulation, in order to enable relative projections, considering the performance assessment (Speed/Power) through measurement on ASIC (ASIC at much smaller scale, representative of overall architecture).
